Description: authorized_keys shim for rsync-over-ssh secure backups.
 This is a helper to allow secured rsync-over-SSH backups.  Usually you
 would specify a "command=" argument in the `authorized_keys` file to limit
 what can be done with this keys.  However, if you just specify a static
 rsync command, you can't change arguments like "bwlimit" or "compress"
 without changing the `authorized_keys` file.
