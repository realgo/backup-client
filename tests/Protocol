On connection, you need to write a command string prefixed by an
ASCII-encoded length and a colon.  For example:

    12:rsync-backup

The command string is a command followed by optional arguments, all
separated by ASCII NUL characters.  For example, to specify a rsync backup
with compression enabled and running at a limit of 100KB/sec:

    36:rsync-backup\0compression\0bwlimit=100

The length can be 0 padded up to 9 characters:

    0000000012:rsync-backup

Commands:

    rsync-backup

        Run an rsync server to send the full system data.

        Options:

            compression

                If sent, "--compress" is used in the rsync server command.

            bwlimit=\d+

                If sent, with digits after the equal sign, the argument
                "--bwlimit" is passed to the rsync server with the
                specified number.
